Mod allows you to choose any customization for your character.
If you want to permanently unlock all customizations so that they remain unlocked even without the mod, set [b]UnlockPermanently = true[/b] in the [i]main.lua[/i] and open each customization category at least once (Head, Hair, Top etc.).

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=1]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Follow the instruction on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]UE4SS for Abiotic Factor[/url] page to download and install latest UE4SS from there.
2. After use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab of this mod to download the mod as a zip file.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]CustomizationUnlocker[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\CustomizationUnlocker\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\CustomizationUnlocker\[/i][/size]
5. Verify that you have installed the mod correctly.
The mod directory should contain a [b]Scripts[/b] folder and an [b]enabled.txt[/b] file.
[size=2][i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\CustomizationUnlocker\Scripts\[/i]
[i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\CustomizationUnlocker\enabled.txt[/i][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]All the configurations are happening in the [b]main.lua[/b][/size]
1. Navigate into mod's directory->Scripts to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be under: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\CustomizationUnlocker\Scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. Under the [b]Configurations[/b] section in the [i]main.lua[/i] you will find a lua variable [b]UnlockPermanently[/b].
Change [b]UnlockPermanently[/b] to [b]true[/b], if you want the mod to unlock customizations permanently.
[code]UnlockPermanently = true
[/code]
4. Don't forget to save your changes!
5. To permanently unlock all customizations, you must open the “Customization” menu in the Main menu and click on each category to load all elements.
[size=2]Keep in mind: Not all customization can be unlocked permanently, some are bound to very specific conditions, like the "The Company" ID only unlocks, if you add [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/408900/]Unfortunate Spacemen[/url] to your Steam library[/size]
